## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`Encoder[T]` typed round-trip, derived from the decoder's own pattern.** The inverse of `Decoder[T]`: `(d *Decoder[T]).Encoder() (*Encoder[T], error)` builds the encoder by inverting the decoder's compiled pattern — no separate template to hand-write or keep in sync. `Encoder()` parses the pattern's AST (`regexp/syntax`) and walks the **invertible subset** into an ordered encode plan: literal runs emitted verbatim, named capture groups resolved to struct fields exactly as `Decoder` resolves them (the `regex:"name"` tag matched exactly, or the field name case-insensitively; `regex:"-"` excluded), anchors and zero-width assertions dropped, and pure-literal unnamed groups treated as literals. `Encoder.Encode(v T) (string, error)` renders `v` so that an `Encode` followed by an `Unmarshal`/`Decoder.One` on the same pattern round-trips the original struct. Any construct with no single string to emit outside a named capture — an alternation (`|`), a quantifier (`*`, `+`, `?`, `{n,m}`), a character class (`[...]`), an any-character wildcard (`.`), or an unnamed group with non-literal content — makes the pattern non-invertible, and `Encoder()` fails fast with a new `errors.Is`-checkable `ErrNotInvertible` sentinel that names the construct. Covers the same field-type set as the decode path (all scalar widths, `bool`, `time.Time` — RFC3339Nano by default or the `layout=` layout — `time.Duration`, and single-level pointers), with a new `RegexMarshaler` (`MarshalRegex() (string, error)`) extension point mirroring `RegexUnmarshaler`, an `encoding.TextMarshaler` fallback, and an `errors.As`-able `*EncodeError` mirroring `DecodeError`. Construction is strict like `Compile` (a non-invertible pattern, a group that maps to no field, or an unencodable field type all fail at `Encoder()`; the field-shape failures wrap `ErrInvalidStruct`). The `default=` tag option does not affect encoding. A possible future refinement is to re-match each encoded value against its group's sub-pattern at `Encode` time. Additive, non-breaking. ([#149](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/149))
- **Tag-derived required-group validation: `regex:"name,required"`.** A struct field can now declare its capture group mandatory inline, removing the need for a separate `Validate` pass in the common case. The `required` flag promotes the first reserved lone-token slot in the tag grammar (previously a silently-ignored no-op — recognizing it is additive and non-breaking per the documented forward-compat plan). When a required field's group does not participate in the match or matches an empty span and no `default=` supplies a value, every decode entrypoint (`Unmarshal`, `UnmarshalAll`, `Decoder.One`/`All`/`Iter`) returns a new `errors.As`-able `*regextra.RequiredGroupError` carrying `Field` and `Group`, wrapped under the entrypoint's `regextra.<Entrypoint>:` prefix. A `default=` satisfies the requirement (it always yields a value). Presence keys on the shared "empty span = data absence" contract (`resolveGroupValue`), so a participating-but-empty span also fails `required`. `RequiredGroupError` is the per-match presence check, distinct from `*DecodeError` (a participating value that failed type conversion) and `*MissingNamedGroupsError` (the static `Validate` check that a pattern declares a group at all). ([#148](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/148))
- **`MissingNamedGroupsError` typed error for `Validate`.** `Validate` now returns an `errors.As`-able `*regextra.MissingNamedGroupsError` whose `Missing []string` field carries the declared-but-absent required group names (in the order passed), so callers can branch on the missing set without parsing `err.Error()`. The error is wrapped with the existing `regextra.Validate:` prefix and its message is unchanged, mirroring the `DecodeError` precedent ([#111](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/111)). A directly-constructed empty value (`&MissingNamedGroupsError{}`, which `Validate` itself never produces) renders `no missing named groups` instead of a message with a dangling separator. Additive, non-breaking. ([#151](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/151))
- **`ErrInvalidPattern` / `ErrInvalidStruct` sentinels for `Compile` / `MustCompile` failure categories.** `Compile` (and `MustCompile`, which panics with the same error) now wraps each of its five validation failures with an `errors.Is`-checkable sentinel: `ErrInvalidPattern` for a bad regular expression, and `ErrInvalidStruct` for every destination-shape problem (`T` is not a struct, a field references an undeclared group, a `default=` value does not convert, or `layout=` sits on a non-`time.Time` field). Each message keeps its existing detail — and, for the pattern-compile and bad-`default=` cases, the underlying cause stays reachable via `errors.Is`/`errors.As` (two-`%w` wrap). Callers can branch on the failure kind instead of parsing `err.Error()`. The sentinels are `Compile`-only: the lenient `Unmarshal` / `UnmarshalAll` path tolerates the same shapes and never surfaces them. Consistent with the typed-error contract ([#111](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/111)); like `ErrNoMatch`, they carry the bare `regextra:` sentinel prefix. Additive, non-breaking. ([#152](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/152))
- **`DecodeError` typed error for conversion failures.** When a matched capture-group value can't be converted to its destination field type, `Unmarshal`, `UnmarshalAll`, and `Decoder.One`/`All`/`Iter` now all return an `errors.As`-able `*regextra.DecodeError` carrying `Field`, `Group`, `Value`, `Type` (rendered), and the wrapped `Err` (reachable via `Unwrap`). They all decode through one shared core (see [#108](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/108)), so they return the same type and callers can branch on a failed field without parsing `err.Error()`. A directly-constructed empty value (`&DecodeError{}`, which the decode path never produces) renders `no decode error` instead of a dangling `field : <nil>` message. Additive, non-breaking. ([#111](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/111))
- **`NamedGroupsPerMatch(re *regexp.Regexp, target string) []map[string]string`** and **`NamedGroupsPerMatchSeq(re *regexp.Regexp, target string) iter.Seq[map[string]string]`** — the every-match counterparts to `NamedGroups`, returning one named-group map per match (slice form) or yielding them lazily (range-over-func form). Each per-match map follows `NamedGroups` semantics: every declared group present, non-participating groups mapped to `""`, and reused names resolved to the last participating occurrence in that match. Fills the gap the `AllNamedGroups` godoc previously disclaimed ("no current function that returns every named group across every match"). Names deliberately avoid the overloaded "All" token. Additive, non-breaking. ([#118](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/118))
- **`ReplaceFirst(re *regexp.Regexp, target string, replacements map[string]string) string`** — like `Replace` but substitutes named-group spans only within the *first* match of `re` in `target`; every later match, and all text outside the first match, passes through byte-for-byte unchanged. Within that first match it follows `Replace`'s rules exactly (a group absent from `replacements` passes through, non-participating groups are skipped, overlapping spans resolve outermost-first) and returns `target` unchanged on no match, per the package doc's "No-match behavior" contract. Implemented by threading a `limit=1` through the shared `replaceNamed` engine, leaving the existing `Replace`/`ReplaceFunc` paths mechanically unchanged. Additive, non-breaking. ([#150](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/150))

### Changed

- **`Unmarshal` / `UnmarshalAll` now run the same shared decode plan as `Decoder`.** Both free functions previously built a per-match `map[string]string` and re-parsed each field's tag on every call (and, for `UnmarshalAll`, on every match); they now build the `Decoder`'s index-based decode plan once via `buildDecodePlan` and execute it through the same `runDecodePlan` core the `Decoder` uses. One set of field-mapping and skip-or-default semantics for all three paths, so they can't drift again (the root cause behind [#104](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/104)/[#105](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/105)/[#106](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/106)). No public API change. Two intentional, non-breaking behavior nuances surface from the unification: (1) a field-conversion failure from `Unmarshal`/`UnmarshalAll` is now the shared typed `*DecodeError` (see Added, [#111](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/111)) wrapped as `regextra.Unmarshal: field X: …` / `regextra.UnmarshalAll: match N: field X: …`, replacing the old `regextra: failed to set field X: …` string; the underlying `cannot convert …` cause is unchanged; and (2) when several distinctly-spelled declared group names fold-equal one untagged field, the field-name fallback now resolves at build time over `re.SubexpNames()` (via `matchGroupName`), binding the declaration-first fold-sibling deterministically instead of relying on the old map-iteration order. Because the build-time fallback is participation-agnostic, this is also a participation change: if the declaration-first fold-sibling does not participate in a match while a later one does, the field is now left unset where the old participating-only fallback (over `namedGroupValues(…, false)`) populated it from the participating sibling. Both effects align `Unmarshal` with `Decoder` (the goal of this change) and are vanishingly rare in practice. ([#108](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/108))
- **Error-message prefixes standardized on `regextra.<Entrypoint>:`.** Constructed and contextual errors now carry the method-qualified prefix already used by `Compile`/`Validate`/`Decoder.All`: `Unmarshal`/`UnmarshalAll`'s argument-validation errors moved from the bare `regextra:` prefix, and `Decoder.One`/`Iter` conversion failures gained the previously-absent prefix. Package-level sentinels (`ErrNoMatch`) keep the bare `regextra:` prefix since a sentinel isn't bound to one entrypoint. Message wording is non-breaking per [README §Stability](./README.md#stability) — compare sentinels/types, not strings. ([#111](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/111))

### Removed

- **`ROADMAP.md` and `docs/v1-readiness.md` removed in favor of issue-tracked planning.** The [issue tracker](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues) is now the single source of truth for individual work items; roadmap themes were triaged into discrete issues ([#148](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/148)–[#154](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/154)) and the v1-readiness audit remains preserved at the `v1.x.x` tags. References in `README.md` and the package doc were repointed to the tracker. No code change. ([#144](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/144))

### Fixed

- **`regex:"-"` now excludes a field instead of falling back to field-name matching. (Breaking.)** Previously `parseFieldTag` collapsed `regex:"-"` and `regex:""` to the same "no name" result, so a field tagged `regex:"-"` would still be populated if a declared group happened to share the field's name — the opposite of the `-` convention in `encoding/json`, `encoding/xml`, and `gopkg.in/yaml`. Now the bare `-` tag excludes the field entirely from both `Unmarshal`/`UnmarshalAll` and `Decoder`. `Decoder` and `UnmarshalAll` build a fresh result, so the field is left at its zero value; `Unmarshal` writes into the caller's struct in place and never resets it, so the field keeps whatever it already held (the zero value for a freshly declared struct). An absent tag (`regex:""`) still falls back to the field's own name as before. Only the bare `-` excludes; a leading `-` followed by options (e.g. `regex:"-,default=x"`) still parses `-` as the group name. **Observable behavior change:** a field tagged `regex:"-"` whose name matches a group is no longer populated. ([#106](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/106))
- **`Decoder` field-name fallback now folds Unicode like `Unmarshal`.** When a struct field has no `regex:"..."` tag, both paths match its name against a declared group case-insensitively via `strings.EqualFold` (Unicode simple-fold). Previously the `Decoder`'s compile-time fallback lowercased ASCII only, so a field whose name differed from the group name by a non-ASCII fold (e.g. group `kelvin` vs a field named with U+212A KELVIN SIGN) bound on the `Unmarshal` path but not on the `Decoder` path. **Observable behavior change:** because `EqualFold` is a true Unicode fold rather than `strings.ToLower`, `Unmarshal`'s own rune matching shifts for a few runes — a field name starting with `İ` (U+0130) that matched an `i…` group under the old `ToLower` comparison no longer matches, and a field containing `ſ` (U+017F) now matches an `s` group it previously did not. Go's `regexp` only allows ASCII capture-group names, so this affects the struct-field side of the comparison only. ([#126](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/pull/126), fixes [#110](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/110))
- **Duplicate group names no longer lose the participating value.** Go's `regexp` allows the same `(?P<name>...)` to appear more than once in a pattern (e.g. across alternation branches), where only one occurrence participates in a given match. Every name-based reader now resolves the occurrence that actually participated instead of trusting `re.SubexpIndex`'s first occurrence or letting a later empty/non-participating occurrence clobber a real value. Affects `NamedGroups`, `Unmarshal`, `UnmarshalAll`, `Decoder.One`/`Decoder.All`/`Decoder.Iter`, `FindNamed`, and `FindAllNamed`. For example, with `(?:x(?P<word>a)|y(?P<word>b))`, `FindNamed(re, "yb", "word")` now returns `("b", true)` (was `("", true)`) and `FindAllNamed(re, "xa yb", "word")` returns `["a", "b"]` (was `["a", ""]`). ([#127](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/pull/127), fixes [#105](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/105))
- **`Unmarshal`/`UnmarshalAll` no longer error on a non-participating optional group with a typed field.** A declared optional group that does not participate in the match (e.g. `(?P<num>\d+)?` against input with no digits) is now left at the field's zero value, matching `Decoder.One`, instead of feeding `""` into the numeric/bool/time conversion and returning `cannot convert "" to …`. Fields with a `default=` still substitute the default as before, and `NamedGroups` still reports a non-participating group as `""`. ([#127](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/pull/127))
- **`Unmarshal`/`UnmarshalAll` also leave the field unchanged on a participating empty-span group, and the skip-or-default contract is now shared.** Building on #127: a group that participated but matched a zero-length span (e.g. `(?P<age>\d*)` against `"Alice:"`) is now treated as data absence on the `Unmarshal` path too — it leaves the field unchanged rather than feeding `""` to the type converter — matching `Decoder`. The skip-or-default decision now lives in one shared helper (`resolveGroupValue`) so the `Unmarshal` and `Decoder` paths can't drift again. ([#123](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/pull/123), fixes [#104](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/104))
  - **Behavior change for struct reuse:** previously a declared group with an absent or empty match wrote `""` into string fields, overwriting pre-populated values. Callers that reuse one struct across `Unmarshal` calls (e.g. per log line) and relied on that implicit reset must now zero the struct between calls. `Decoder` always decodes into a fresh zero value, so it is unaffected — its semantics are the contract both paths now follow.

### Performance

- Switching the `Decoder` to the index-returning match functions (`FindStringSubmatchIndex` / `FindAllStringSubmatchIndex`) — required to tell a participating-empty group from a non-participating one — also drops a per-match allocation: `Decoder.One` on a simple struct goes from 3 allocs to 2 (−40% B/op) and `Decoder.Iter` over 100 log lines from 309 allocs to 209 (−32%). ([#127](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/pull/127))
- **`UnmarshalAll` no longer allocates a `map[string]string` per match or re-parses field tags per match.** Routing both free functions through the shared decode plan ([#108](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/108)) hoists the name→index resolution and tag parsing to once per call, removing the per-match map build and per-field `parseFieldTag` work the old `populateStruct` loop paid on every match — a direct win on the multi-match path (`BenchmarkUnmarshalAll` `matches100`/`matches1000`). ([#108](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/issues/108))

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-05

The API-stability stamp. Every public surface in `regextra.go`, `unmarshal.go`, and `decoder.go` was audited by the v1-readiness review (`docs/v1-readiness.md`) and carries a documented `Keep` verdict. The three "change before v1" blockers from that review (`AllNamedGroups` naming, tag-grammar reservation policy, no-match contract) all resolved as documentation lock-ins — every behavior in the v0.5.0 release ships unchanged into v1.0.0.

**The promise.** Post-v1, breaking changes ship in the next major version, never in a minor or patch. Adopters can pin `v1` and follow minor/patch updates without re-reading release notes for migration steps. See [README §Stability](./README.md#stability) for the precise definition of "breaking" and the non-breaking change set (additions, new tag-option keys, additional field types, error-message wording).

**No code changes** vs `v0.5.0`. The release exists to mark the stability commitment and to land the documentation that locks in pre-v1 contracts as v1 contracts.

### Documentation

- **`AllNamedGroups` naming clarified for v1.** Rewrote the `AllNamedGroups` docstring and the README's reference entry to lead with the duplicate-group-name use case and to state explicitly that the function operates on a single match — the leading "All" refers to all named groups in one match, not to all matches in the target. `FindAllNamed`'s cross-reference now calls out the asymmetry rather than implying symmetry. The package doc's "API at a glance" entry was also corrected (it previously read "every named group across all matches", which inverts the actual behavior). Resolution of the `re-zwj` v1 blocker — option 3 (lock in current name, fix the docs) chosen over rename or new helper, on the grounds that the name is technically correct, the roadmap does not commit to a future `[]map[string]string` shape, and rename pre-v1 has real adopter cost. Behavior unchanged. (re-zwj)
- **Tag grammar reservation policy documented.** Added a "Tag grammar" section to the package doc (visible on pkg.go.dev) and a matching block to the README's Tag options reference. Locks in two forward-compat rules as v1 contract: unknown `key=value` pairs are preserved (so adding new option keys in a minor release is non-breaking) and lone tokens without `=` are silently ignored (reserving the slot for future flag-style options like `required`). Callers must not rely on either as permanent — pin a minor version range if a specific recognized set is required. `parseFieldTag`'s docstring cross-references the canonical section. Behavior unchanged. (re-c4f)
- **No-match contract documented.** Added a "No-match behavior" section to the package doc (visible on pkg.go.dev) covering every public function's no-match return. Locks in the intentional asymmetry — `Unmarshal` returns `nil`, `Decoder.One` returns `ErrNoMatch` — as v1 contract, with the rationale spelled out (the `(T, error)` return shape would otherwise make no-match indistinguishable from "decoded a struct of all zero fields"). Per-function docstrings (`Unmarshal`, `UnmarshalAll`, `AllNamedGroups`, `Replace`, `Decoder.One`) cross-reference the canonical section. Behavior unchanged. (re-ne3)
  - Drive-by fix: `Unmarshal`'s godoc previously claimed it "returns an error if the pattern does not match the target string" — the implementation has always returned `nil` on no match. Docstring now matches behavior.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-26

The architectural perf release. Adds `Decoder[T]` — a typed, regex-bound unmarshaler that compiles its decode plan once and reuses it across calls. **~45% faster on simple-struct decode and ~37% faster on streaming log-line iteration** vs the existing free-function `Unmarshal` / `UnmarshalAll`.

Additive minor release. `Unmarshal` and `UnmarshalAll` keep working unchanged.

### Added

- **`Compile[T any](pattern string) (*Decoder[T], error)`** and **`MustCompile[T any](pattern string) *Decoder[T]`** — construct a typed decoder. Compile-time validation surfaces invalid pattern, non-struct `T`, undeclared group references, malformed `default=` values, and `layout=` on non-`time.Time` fields. Use `MustCompile` for package-level vars where startup-time failure is the right behavior. ([#69](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/pull/69))
- **`Decoder[T].One(target string) (T, error)`** — decode the first match. Returns sentinel `ErrNoMatch` (compare with `errors.Is`) when there's no match. ([#69](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/pull/69))
- **`Decoder[T].All(target string) ([]T, error)`** — decode every match into a slice. Returns empty slice + nil error when there are no matches. ([#69](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/pull/69))
- **`Decoder[T].Iter(target string) iter.Seq2[T, error]`** — range-over-func streaming decode. Pairs each match with its per-match decode error so callers can skip individual failures without aborting the whole iteration. Skips the slice allocation `All` performs; `break` in the range body avoids decoding the remaining matches. ([#71](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/pull/71))
- **`Decoder[T].Pattern() string`** — debug accessor for the regex source.
- **`ErrNoMatch`** — exported sentinel returned by `Decoder.One` when there's no match. ([#69](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/pull/69))

### Changed

- Tests converted to `package regextra_test` (external test package). Forces all test code through the public API surface — same way users will call the package — and prevents accidental coupling to unexported internals. Mirrors stdlib precedent (`encoding/json`, `regexp`, `net/http`). `decoder_test.go` shipped external from #69; the older three test files converted in #70. ([#70](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/pull/70))
- `TestParseFieldTag` dropped — `parseFieldTag` is unexported, and tag-parsing behavior is already covered end-to-end by `TestUnmarshalDefault` and `TestUnmarshalLayoutOverride`. Granular vs. integration coverage is a wash for a small library, and dropping the direct test makes future tag-parser refactors cheaper. ([#70](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/pull/70))

### Performance

Apple M4, Go 1.24, baselines from the existing benchmarks:

| Benchmark | v0.4.0 | v0.5.0 (Decoder) | delta |
|-----------|-------:|----------------:|------:|
| Simple-struct decode (one match) | 496 ns/op, 6 allocs | **270 ns/op, 3 allocs** | ~45% faster, 50% fewer allocs |
| 100-line log iteration | 48 µs/op, 608 allocs | **30 µs/op, 309 allocs** (Iter) | ~37% faster, ~50% fewer allocs |

Win comes from skipping the per-call `SubexpNames()` map build and per-field `parseFieldTag` work — both run once at Compile, never again. `Iter` additionally skips the result-slice allocation that `UnmarshalAll` performs.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-26

Additive minor release. No breaking changes — every existing field type, function signature, and tag form keeps working. New surface area in three buckets: extraction helpers, an extension point for caller-defined types, and richer `Unmarshal` field-type support.

### Added

- **`FindAllNamed(re, target, groupName) []string`** — collects every value of a single named group across all matches. Returns `nil` when the group is not declared on the regex; an empty slice when declared but no matches. Fills the gap between `FindNamed` (one match, one group) and `AllNamedGroups` (all matches, all groups). ([#58](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/pull/58))
- **`Replace(re, target, replacements map[string]string) string`** — substitutes the matched span of each named capture group with the value from the map. Operates on every match in order; groups absent from the map pass through unchanged. ([#59](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/pull/59))
- **`Validate(re, required ...string) error`** — returns an error listing required group names not declared on the regex. Init-time assertion that catches typos at startup instead of at the first mismatched request. ([#60](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/pull/60))
- **`RegexUnmarshaler` interface** — mirror of `encoding.TextUnmarshaler` for the regextra unmarshal path. When a destination field's pointer type satisfies this interface, `Unmarshal` calls `UnmarshalRegex(value)` instead of running the built-in type switch. The extension point for caller-defined types (URLs, enums, big numbers, IP addresses, custom timestamp formats). ([#61](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/pull/61))
- **`time.Time` and `time.Duration` field support in `Unmarshal`** — `time.Time` tries RFC3339Nano, RFC3339, DateTime, DateOnly, TimeOnly in order; `time.Duration` parses via `time.ParseDuration`. Caught by Type before the kind switch so `time.Duration`'s underlying `int64` doesn't pre-empt the duration parser. ([#62](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/pull/62))
- **Pointer field support in `Unmarshal`** — nil pointers are allocated; non-nil pointers are reused with the pointee overwritten. Covers the optional-field idiom (`*string`, `*int`, `*time.Time`, …) without forcing a `RegexUnmarshaler` wrapper. Single-level pointers are the documented contract. ([#63](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/pull/63))
- **Tag options: `default=<value>` and `layout=<go-time-layout>`** — `default=` substitutes when the named group is undeclared or its match is empty (goes through type conversion, so `default=100` works on `int` fields). `layout=` pins `time.Time` parsing to a specific layout for non-RFC3339 sources (Apache logs, locale-specific timestamps). Tag grammar is JSON-encoding-style: `regex:"name,key=value,key=value"`. ([#64](https://github.com/Jecoms/regextra/pull/64))

### Changed

- `setFieldValue` dispatch order is now: pointer → `RegexUnmarshaler` → `time.Time`/`time.Duration` Type match → kind switch. Ordering is intentional and asserted by tests — `RegexUnmarshaler` must come before `time.Time` so a `type MyTime time.Time` with its own `UnmarshalRegex` isn't pre-empted by the time-types fast path; the time-types Type match must come before the kind switch so `time.Duration`'s underlying `Int64` kind doesn't pre-empt `time.ParseDuration`.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- Fuzz harnesses (`fuzz_test.go`) covering the public API surface: `FuzzFindNamed` and `FuzzNamedGroups` exercise the regex-resolution paths and contract; `FuzzUnmarshalInt`, `FuzzUnmarshalUint`, `FuzzUnmarshalFloat`, `FuzzUnmarshalBool` drive each `strconv`-backed branch of the Unmarshal type-conversion code with arbitrary inputs. Seed corpus covers stdlib edge cases (sign-prefixed, scientific notation, MAX/MIN bounds, NaN/Inf, locale-flavored bool variants, unicode, NUL bytes).

### Changed
- CI test matrix expanded from `['1.24']` to `['1.24', '1.25', '1.26']` so regressions on newer toolchains surface in CI without raising the consumer floor (`go.mod` stays at 1.24). `fail-fast: false` lets all three legs finish so triage shows which version broke first. Lint and vet jobs stay on 1.24.
- CI runs each fuzz target for 10 seconds on the floor matrix leg (Go 1.24) — adds ~60 seconds to one job leg, doesn't multiply across the matrix. Seed corpus runs unconditionally on every leg via the regular `go test` step.

### Fixed
- `auto-tag.yml` now publishes the GitHub Release in the same job that pushes the tag, sidestepping the `GITHUB_TOKEN` cascade limitation that previously prevented `release.yml` from firing on automated tag pushes (every release since v0.3.0 had a tag but no Release until manual `gh release create`). The "Delete release branch" step is now best-effort: it checks `git ls-remote` first and prints an info line if the branch was already auto-deleted by the repo's merge-cleanup setting, instead of exiting non-zero.

### Removed
- `release.yml` workflow — its tag-listening / test-running / release-creation steps are now folded into `auto-tag.yml`.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- Issue and pull request templates: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/{bug_report,feature_request}.md` plus `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. Issue templates ask for the regex pattern, input string, expected vs actual, and Go / regextra / OS versions; PR template prompts for type-of-change, the CHANGELOG entry, and a test plan. `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` routes open-ended questions to GitHub Discussions and disables blank issues.

### Security
- New CodeQL workflow (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`) — runs Go static analysis on every PR, push to `main`, and weekly on Monday 09:00 UTC. Findings surface in the Security tab.
- New govulncheck workflow (`.github/workflows/govulncheck.yml`) — installs `golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck` and scans on every PR, push to `main`, and weekly. Catches stdlib + transitive-dep CVEs.

### Changed
- CI: enforce 85% coverage floor on the `test` job. The job now parses `go tool cover -func=coverage.txt` and fails when total coverage falls below the threshold. Codecov upload is unaffected.
- CI: validate every PR title against Conventional Commits. Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `build`, `revert`, `style`. Squash-merge turns the PR title into the commit subject, so this is the gate that matters.
- CI: auto-merge Dependabot PRs for the safe class — all `github-actions` ecosystem bumps and `gomod` `direct:development` patch/minor bumps. Production direct deps and major bumps still require human review.

### Dependencies
- Bumped `actions/checkout` from 5.0.0 to 6.0.2 (Dependabot #28).

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-06

### Added
- **NEW**: `Unmarshal` function for type-safe regex extraction into structs
  - Supports struct tags (`regex:"groupname"`) for field mapping
  - Automatic type conversion for int, uint, float, bool types
  - Field mapping priority: struct tag > exact name > case-insensitive match
  - Comprehensive error handling for validation
- **NEW**: `UnmarshalAll` function for extracting multiple matches into slice of structs
  - Processes all pattern matches in target string
  - Returns slice of populated structs
  - Clears slice when no matches found
- CONTRIBUTING.md guide for contributors and AI agents
- Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates
- Automatic release tagging workflow (tags releases when release PRs are merged)
  - Validates semver format
  - Prevents duplicate tags
  - Automatically cleans up release branches

### Changed
- Updated golangci-lint configuration to v2 format
- Applied Go 1.24 best practices (range over integers, SetLen for slice clearing)
- Modernized API to use `any` instead of `interface{}`
- Test matrix now only tests on Go 1.24 (matching go.mod requirement)

### Security
- Hardened GitHub Actions workflows with SHA-pinned actions
- Added explicit permissions blocks to workflows
- Removed version comments from action SHAs (Dependabot compatibility)
- Replaced deprecated actions/create-release with GitHub CLI
- Reduced third-party dependencies in CI/CD

### Dependencies
- Bumped actions/checkout from 4.3.0 to 5.0.0
- Bumped actions/setup-go from 5.5.0 to 6.0.0
- Bumped codecov/codecov-action from 4.6.0 to 5.5.1
- Bumped golangci/golangci-lint-action from 4.0.1 to 8.0.0

## [0.2.1] - 2025-10-04

### Added
- `AllNamedGroups` function to extract all values for each named capture group as `map[string][]string`
- Handles patterns with duplicate group names, collecting all matches for each group name
- Comprehensive test coverage for `AllNamedGroups` including duplicate group name scenarios
- Example test for `AllNamedGroups` for pkg.go.dev documentation

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-04

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Simplified to function-only API (removed wrapper struct)
- **BREAKING**: Renamed functions for better idiomatic Go style:
  - `SubexpValue` → `FindNamed`
  - `SubexpMap` → `NamedGroups`
- All functions now accept `*regexp.Regexp` as first parameter
- Updated documentation with simpler usage examples
- Updated to Go 1.24

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Removed `Regexp` wrapper type
- **BREAKING**: Removed `Compile()` and `MustCompile()` constructors
- Removed deprecated `SubexpValue` and `SubexpMap` functions

### Added
- Comprehensive package documentation
- 100% test coverage
- Example tests for pkg.go.dev
- GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows
- golangci-lint configuration
- Badges in README (Go Reference, Go Report Card, Tests, License)
- Automated release workflow

## [0.1.0] - Initial Release

### Added
- Basic named capture group extraction functionality
- `Regextra` wrapper type
- `SubexpValue` and `SubexpMap` methods
